# About

The JavaScript minimax algorithm is a technique used in game development and artificial intelligence to determine the best possible move in a two-player, zero-sum game.

The algorithm recursively evaluates all possible moves and outcomes for a given player and opponent. It assigns a score to each possible game state and assumes that both players will make optimal decisions to maximize or minimize this score, depending on whether they are the maximizing (trying to win) or minimizing (trying to prevent the opponent from winning) player. The algorithm then selects the move that leads to the best possible outcome for the player it's currently evaluating.

This algorithm is often used to create intelligent game-playing agents that can make strategic decisions in games.
